Speleologists produce large amounts of information: literature of course, but also a lot of data useful for sports practice and scientific research.

This mass of information has benefited from different methods and systems of collection and classification, which have evolved with the techniques of exploration, topographic survey and conservation available. The information collected is often difficult to access because it is sparse or not sustainable; they can disappear if they are not shared.

The [Grottocenter site](https://grottocenter.org) is a tool created in 2008, which aims to make this speleological information more accessible and more relevant.

A page (in French) on [Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grottocenter) tells the story of the project

If you want to have the important points in a few lines, Grottocenter is:
- A collaborative project in which everyone can participate
- Freely accessible data with tools to facilitate the use of available information
- Tools and an approach to protect the underground environment while sharing essential information to better understand it

Do you want to participate? computer development, data entry, translation, promotion of the project... What you want to do is essential since it will give us the opportunity to work together
